# Automated Questioner: a T5 Fine-tuned Questionnaire Generation System

English | [中文](README-cn.md)

Welcome to the T5 Fine-tuned Questionnaire Generation System project! This project provides a set of tools and scripts for generating questionnaires using the T5 large pre-trained language model. With this system, you can easily generate high-quality questionnaires for various purposes, such as surveys, assessments, and data collection.

## Background

The T5 model is a state-of-the-art language model that has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. By fine-tuning this model on specific tasks, such as questionnaire generation, we can leverage its language understanding capabilities to generate relevant and coherent questions.

This project aims to simplify the process of fine-tuning the T5 model for questionnaire generation and provide a user-friendly interface for generating questionnaires.

## Features

- Fine-tuning scripts for training the T5 model on questionnaire generation tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the T5 Fine-tuned Questionnaire Generation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone this project to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/Barber0/AutomatedQuestioner`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install transformers tokenizers datasets`
3. Download the pre-trained T5 model checkpoint.
4. Fine-tune the T5 model on your questionnaire generation dataset using the provided script.

Please refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on dataset preparation, fine-tuning, and generating questionnaires.
